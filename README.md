<h2>Project Plan: UX-Focused Website for the Accounting Firm</h2>

<h3>1. Define the Goal</h3>
Objective: Design a simple, professional, and user-friendly website for the accounting firm.
  
<h4>Primary Focus:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>UX Design & Research: Ensure intuitive navigation and easy access to key information.</li>

<div>
<h3>2. Conduct UX Research</h3>
<h4>User Research & Competitive Analysis</h4>
<p>
Since this is a small business, what do clients expect from an accounting firm’s website?
Look at competitor sites and note best practices (e.g., clear pricing, service listings).
If possible, interview firm members about what they’d like on their website.
</p>

<h3>3. Create User Personas & Journeys</h3>

</ul>
