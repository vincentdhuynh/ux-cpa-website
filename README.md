# Judy Nieh CPA Website Design & Development

As part of my UX-focused web development projects, I am designing and building a professional, user-friendly website for Judy Nieh CPA. The goal is to create a modern, accessible, and intuitive platform that highlights the firm’s accounting, tax preparation, and financial consulting services.

This project involves:
<ul>
<li>User research & competitive analysis to understand client needs.</li>
<li>Wireframing & prototyping for an optimized user experience.</li>
<li>Responsive front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
<li>Accessibility & usability testing to ensure a seamless experience for all users.</li>
<li>The final product will be a fully functional, mobile-friendly website that enhances the firm’s online presence and provides clients with easy access to essential services.</li>
</ul>
